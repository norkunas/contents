## Aciety Cooperation Agreement Annex No. 3

1. ### Introduction
    This Annex applies to all Users, who have received above zero value Pledge
    Allowance figure from Aciety in their Aciety Cooperation Agreements and who
    have a Confirmed Pledge.
    This Annex serves as basis for Full Pledge Agreement and Pledger understands
    this Annex will be updated, new version of TAP released and they will
    receive the reward only by fulfilling the conditions of the Full Pledge
    Agreement. Aciety agrees that if Pledger fulfills the conditions of Full
    Pledge Agreement, they will receive the equal amount of the new version of
    TAP to their Pledge Reward.

    #### Definitions:
      1. **TAP** – Coupon Token of Aciety Platform, 1 unit of which represents
         1/10,000,000 of Total Pledged Value in Aciety.
      1. **XTAP** - exchange rate of TAP to EUR when buying Pledged IP for TAP:
         1 TAP = Total Pledged Value / 10,000,000.
      1. **Pledged IP** -  All Intellectual Property listed in Aciety
         Marketplace by the Pledger as part of their Pledge.
      1. **Pledge** - Minimum value in EUR of Pledged IP that can be bought
         from Pledger using TAP at XTAP rate.
      1. **Pledger** – User, which has received above zero Pledge Allowance
         figure from Aciety and has signed above zero Pledge value in any way
         specified in this Annex.
      1. **Pledge Allowance** – Maximum Pledge value as determined by Aciety
         for a particular User.
      1. **Confirmed Pledge** – Pledge value signed by Pledger in their Aciety
         Cooperation Agreement, or later add via Aciety System, or sent via email
         to pledges@aciety.com and confirmed by Aciety with corresponding Pledge
         Reward.
      1. **Total Pledged Value** - Sum value in EUR of all Pledges from
         Confirmed Pledges + 1 million EUR.
      1. **Pledge Reward** - Reward in  TAP coupons for Pledger for their
         Confirmed Pledge = 1.25% * Pledge / XTAP.
      1. **Total Pledge Rewards** – Sum of TAP coupons in all Pledge Rewards.
      1. **Full Pledge Agreement** - An updated version of this Annex, released
         in reference to exceeding the first milestone of 10 million EUR in Total
         Pledged Value.
      1. **Distributed TAP** – TAP distributed by Aciety to stakeholders
         according to conditions of Aciety Coupon Model.
      1. **Circulation** – Distributed TAP, not held in Aciety wallets, or held
         in Aciety wallets on behalf of Users.

    #### Because:
      1. Aciety has created and is in control of Aciety Marketplace, that is
         used to buy, sell and exchange software;
      1. Aciety pre-screens software producers to find ones that have valuable
         and marketable products;
      1. Aciety helps clients to find the most suitable software development
         partners and software products for their particular (usually high scale,
         long-term) need;
      1. Aciety has launched a coupon, which is meant to encourage code re-use,
         marketing and reward system for TAP stakeholders;
      1. Aciety is releasing 10 million TAP coupons, each divisible to 100
         million parts;
      1. The coupon has clear buying power, based on Total Pledged Value that
         pledgers make for their software;
      1. Pledging is designed to ensure TAP buys at least as much software
         (or more)compared to the date it was distributed, ensuring future use for
         the pledging producer and other stakeholders (ex. Service providers buying
         products for clients);  
      1. Coupons are distributed in a unique model (Aciety Coupon Model),
         creating unparalleled affiliate opportunities:
        1. First TAP is backed by software, only then it reaches the market;
        1. TAP buying power grows with new pledges, substituting the need for
           conventional affiliate commission;
      1. TAP is released as ERC20 token (on Ethereum Network), but Aciety is
         blockchain platform agnostic - eventually there will be a fixed number
         (10 million) coupons, which may float in multiple blockchain platforms;
         The vision of TAP is software trading protocol, which would standardize
         access to global software and efficiently enable to exchange, buy, sell,
         bundle, market and otherwise grow access to quality software, maximize its
         use (and minimize code repetition), independently of any central
         platform - Aciety becoming just one of the distributors, using the
         protocol and all others accessing the information in the same terms as
         specified by software producers (Pledgers);
      1. The vision of TAP is software trading protocol, which would standardize
         access to global software and efficiently enable to exchange, buy, sell,
         bundle, market and otherwise grow access to quality software, maximize its
         use (and minimize code repetition), independently of any central platform -
         Aciety becoming just one of the distributors, using the protocol and all
         others accessing the information in the same terms as specified by software
         producers (Pledgers);

1. ### General Conditions
    1. **Pledged Software** – Pledger confirms: a) they have full rights to
       sell or otherwise distribute the software they listed on Aciety
       Marketplace;
       b) descriptions of such software are accurate and not misleading;
       c) they took necessary steps and will honor any purchase over 100 TAP for
       their Pledged IP at equal terms as their traditional clients with up to
       one work day delay; d) they will provide Aciety an up to date pricing of
       their Pledged IP and that it will be used when calculating how much TAP
       at XTAP rate should be used to pay for the Pledged IP; e) if pricing in
       EUR or any other currency in Pledger’s official website (or websites) is
       less than stated in Aciety Marketplace, Aciety and/or any TAP holder can
       request such pricing to be used when using TAP for purchase; f) they will
       provide support to buyers of their Pledged IP as stated by the Pledger in
       Pledged IP licenses and/or their product page descriptions.  
    1. **Pledged Value** – Pledger confirms: a) they understand Pledge refers to
       sales in TAP and represents the minimum value in EUR in Pledged IP that
       they would continue to sell in Aciety Marketplace if they would request
       to terminate their Pledge (if Pledger returns their Pledge Reward in full
       to Aciety, Pledge Minimum value would be used instead of Pledge value);
       b) they understand that if they request to terminate the Pledge, 25%
       (twenty five per-cent) on all earnings from sales of their Pledged IP in
       TAP would go to Supplier Pool and Client Pool in equal splits and
       remaining 75% (seventy five per-cent) would be distributed to the Pledger
       only once Total Pledged Value grows higher than it is at the date the
       Pledger requested to terminate their Pledge.
    1. **Pledge Allowance** – If Pledge is equal to Pledge Allowance, then Pledge
       applies to all Pledged IP. If Pledge is less than Pledge Allowance, then
       Pledger specifies which products are part of their Pledged IP in Aciety
       Marketplace. Pledge Allowance is no more than (lowest of the following
       values, but not less than 25,000 EUR): a) specified by Aciety on
       individual case basis; b) 10% (ten per-cent) of Total Pledged Value;
    1. **Pledge Reward** – Pledges are done on reservation basis (i.e. Pledge
       becomes active once there is certain Total Pledged Value reached). If any
       of the reservations expire before the Pledger signs this Agreement, Aciety
       may automatically put them in earlier position, granting Pledger higher TAP
       reward and notifying them to their official e-mail address, without the
       need to sign any additional updates to the Agreement.
    1. **TAP Distribution** -  Aciety has issued and distributes 10 million coupons,
       represented by its cryptographic token, called TAP. Multiple versions of
       TAP may be released by Aciety and Aciety will exchange the older versions
       of TAP to the newer ones to retain a total of up to 10 million units of
       TAP in Circulation. Pledger confirms they will accept TAP at XTAP rate for
       as long as Aciety distributes TAP as per Aciety Coupon Model. If Pledger
       fulfills all conditions within this Agreement, they will receive Pledge
       Reward. If Pledger does not fulfill any of the conditions in this
       Agreement, they may receive a penalty up to the size of their Pledge
       Reward, paid in TAP to Aciety.
    1. **Other Conditions** – Aciety has made 1 million EUR pledge as a first
       pledger and will accept TAP for its products placed in Aciety Marketplace
       for as long as there will be any TAP in Circulation. Aciety maintains
       database of all Pledges and gives access to a list of products that could
       be bought for TAP to any TAP holder, owning over 1000 TAP if requested,
       with limitations as set by Pledgers.
    1. **Untimely Termination** – In case Pledger cannot fulfill their Pledge
       anymore for any reason on their own, they agree to pass access to Pledged
       IP to Aciey with the right to sell such Pledged IP for the amount equal to
       Pledge with all sales proceedings going in equal splits to Supplier Pool
       and Client Pool.

1. ### Aciety Coupon Model

    Aciety has designed a coupon distribution model, which ensures that TAP
    is distributed primarily to its stakeholders and in a way that enables it
    to become a product – a cryptographic coupon that buys software. In order
    to maximize growth of Aciety Marketplace and TAP adoption, there is a
    limited number of TAP (ten million coupons), distributed between five
    coupon pools, each with certain distribution conditions:

    1. **Supplier Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to Pledgers as
       Pledge Reward, per its reward formula.  
    1. **Partner Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to partners, who
       should provide substantial growth in Aciety Marketplace clientele, or
       Pledgers. Limitation – Aciety has a right to reward partners in total no
       more than 2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of time.
    1. **Infrastructure Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to
       infrastructure producers, who contribute legal, technological, or business
       support to expansion of Aciety Marketplace and/or use cases for TAP.
       Limitation – Aciety has a right to reward infrastructure producers in total
       no more than 2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of
       time.
    1. **Client Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons sold as software coupons to
       Aciety clients (with intention to favor software service companies, which
       could use TAP to buy products for their clientele). Limitation – Aciety has
       a right to sell clients in total no more than
       2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of time.
    1. **Team Pool** -  2 million (20%) TAP coupons split between shareholders
       and employees of Aciety. Limitations: a) Locked for 1 year from the moment
       Total Pledged Value will surpass 10 million EUR; b) Unlocked afterwards
       proportionally based on formula: 0.25 * ( TAP distributed to Pledgers +
       partners + infrastructure producers + clients).
